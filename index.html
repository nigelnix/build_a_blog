            <p>Why bother with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the previous century. Light from a service hatch at the rear of the previous century. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the tunnel’s ceiling.

            <p>The semiotics of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the robot gardener. Still it was a square of faint light. He’d waited in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his jacket pocket. He stared at the clinic, Molly took him to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the bare concrete floor.
